This repository is for a gravity simulator sandbox built in Unity, designed to simulate gravitational interactions in a visually engaging and interactive manner. The project is intended to be deployed on a webpage, making it easily accessible for users to explore and experiment with gravity. This project draws significant inspiration from the [TestTubeGames Gravity Simulator](https://www.testtubegames.com/gravity.html).
